**Movie Review Website**

Using frontend frameworks, Bootstrap and React, I built a Movie Review website 
that displays movies stored in a MongoDB database that interacts with the backend 
through API. The Backend uses SpringBoot and Java. To tunnel the website Ngrok 
was used and to test HTTP requests PostMan was used.
