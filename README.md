**Movie Review Website**

Using frontend frameworks, Bootstrap and React, I built a Movie Review website 
that displays movies and trailers. All the movies and associated attributes are stored
in MongoDB. The Backend uses SpringBoot and Java. To tunnel the website Ngrok 
was used and to test HTTP requests PostMan was used.
